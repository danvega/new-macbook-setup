# MacBook Pro M1 Max (14-inch, 2021) Setup

I have been looking forward to getting this computer ever since the M1 was released in 2020. In this setup I will walk you through my process for setting up my new MacBook Pro. If you have any questions or suggestions please contact me or send me a pull request. The laptop I am setting up with this document is:

- MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021)
- Chip: Apple M1 Max
- Memory 32GB

## Setup Laptop on Desk

The first thing I did was set this up on my desk, connect my external monitors and hook up all of my peripherals:

 - LG 4k Display
 - Dell Ultrawide Display
 - Apple Magic Keybaord
 - Mx Master Mouse (I also went into preferences and changed the speed of the mouse)
 - Microphone
 - Camera
 - Lights
 - AirPods Pro
 - Headphones (wyze)

## macOS Updates

The first thing I do is run any updates that are available. In my case, the laptop came preloaded with macOS Monterey and there was a 12.0.1 update avaible. You can find these updates by going to preferences > Software Updates.
